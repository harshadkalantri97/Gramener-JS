# Gramener-JS
This is the task you have assigned to do.

The first task was to create stack boxes by add and remove function. 
Here it goes.

First we created two functions using jquery and javascript with <div id = "main" class

We used font-function with increase and decrease in stack functions

the we assigned two buttons to two functions.

To set a limit we used the if-else loop to set a limit 99.
 With each increase in stack, our specail colors taken affect.
 
 for n%2 ==0 (" Black color ")
 else 
  n%2 ==1 ("blue color")
  
  for n%5 ==0 ( orange padding)
  
  the we created add and delete functions stack and count using if-else loop and count assignments.
  
  took some help for syntax from internet but all done in a perfect manner.
